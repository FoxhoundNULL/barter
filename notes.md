# issues

### technical
- ~~figure out how to do icons~~
- ~~show third party auth icons on avatars and maybe next to usernames~~
- figure out issue with native usernames overlapping with third party auth usernames
  - showing third party auth icons on avatars partially solves this
- alternate profile pages for native users vs third party auth
- make intro page for newly registered users
- have third party auth redirect to correct place depending on whether it was a login or registration
- email notifications
- tags on requests should be displayed in the order they were added by the creator of the request
- make it so you can see the agreed upon offer on a request with an accepted proposal
- captchas on the appropriate pages
- syntax highlighting
